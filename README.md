<h2 style="font-size: 15px;">Aircraft Performance Calculator</h2>
 
Aerodynamics is the study of how things fly through air. 
The core of aerodynamics is understanding how air flows over surfaces and how that affects engineering characteristics like speed, lift, drag resistance, and stability.

<h2 style="font-size: 15px;">Satellite Tracker</h2>Â 

Polar visualizations use a polar coordinate system, with the observer's location at the center and azimuth (horizontal angle) and elevation (vertical angle) as the coordinates to plot satellite passes relative to the observer's geographic location on Earth.
